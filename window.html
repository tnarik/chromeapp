    <div>Hello, world!</div>
    <div>Due to Chrome Extension limitations, the actual downloading of files should/could take place
      here. My only doubt (currently) is if that is the best approach due to the phasing out of Chrome Apps.
    </div>
    <div>In reality, this could be a node.js app directly, acting as a worker for the Extension triggered
      action, based on Extension data (multi-device sync'ed knowledge of hosts and pages, with local
      folders for download).</div>
